# Real Time Bus Tracker

### Tracks Boston Buses between MIT and Harvard campuses

##### This app uses a Google Maps API in combination with an API provided by the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority to mark 
each bus on this route (going between MIT and Harvard) in real time. 

Features:
- Updates every 15 seconds
- Busses are colored red or blue based on the direction
- No user input needed

To run this project you can either fork this repository and view it on your computer
or see it in action at (https://ilyaflaks.github.io/bus-tracker/)[https://ilyaflaks.github.io/bus-tracker/]
Note that in the first case you might need to plug in your own Google Maps API key in mapanimation.js
